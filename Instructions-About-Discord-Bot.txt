Hii there so let's directly go to the topic 

So first we need to see how to make a bot 

First you need to create a discord account then go to the discord developer protal (just search in google) login to the devloper protal
Now just head on to applications in devloper protal and create a application and go to bot and add bot 
So there in the bot thing you will find click to reveal token then copy the token and paste the token in the py file 

Now how to add the bot to the server is you need administrator permissions to add the bot to a server 
Go to Oauth2 and there you will find some list there find bot and click the checkbox over there and then down you will find a link copy the link and paste in any browser to add the bot
And select the server in which you want to add the bot...
There you go solve captcha code and the bot's in
You need to run the py file so that the bot will run and you can type the commands

Thanks for your time
