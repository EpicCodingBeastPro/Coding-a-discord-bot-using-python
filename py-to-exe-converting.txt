So yeah if you are done with the code whatever you want then you need not to open the editor and run it you can make exe file and run

First of all you need to install pyinstaller

pip install pyinstaller

Now go to the path where the py file is there like to move to any folder or path you need to use 

cd desktop
cd python

or whereever your py file is in
cd let you to move to the path folder or destination 

In cmd or terminal type :
pyinstaller --onefile "filename.py"
example:
pyinstaller --onefile "Making-A-Discord-bot-Using-Python.py"

Thanks for your time
